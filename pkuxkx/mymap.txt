1\build map database
 1\using bfs to explore locations
 2\location properties:id/area/roomname/roomdesc/exits/npcs/path from ct/path back to ct/xyz coordiate from ct
   ct: the xiaoyaoyou ct.the initial location to explore the area
   id:digest from area+roomname+roomdesc+exits+num
  0: init:go to xiaoyaoyou ct,put ct in unexplored set.(a list) store the info of the room .
  1: get first room from unexplored set.,look exits to get the following rooms,store the relations.put the following rooms in unexplored set(at tail).put previous room in explored set.
	if the room got from unexplored set is on the bordary,put it in explored set directly.
   loop step 1 untill the unexplored set is empty. or the pre-defined depth is reached. 

maintain the unexplored / explored set in tintin,tt also store very room's path from ct/path back to ct/xy coordiate from ct
store room info/relation in python
using #log file to transfer data between tt and python.include path from ct/path back to ct/xy coordiate from ct
python return room id to tt
